            <p>This year I will become a junior web developer and finish my academic studies with it. Within this year,
                I will work hard without compromising to become a full-fledged programmer. At the end of learning I will
                try to give all my friends ideas about programming.</p>

            <p>Who doesn't know the feeling: You are enthusiastic about something and try with all your might to achieve
                the best results for your hearts concern. But what if your „might“ is limited?

                The story of destination:development is a success story. This is why I, Kerstin, would like to talk
                quite openly today about limitations we are facing - just as any other young organisation does.

                All beginnings are difficult, so they say, but I don't quite agree. The beginning of every new project
                is charmed by the energy of new beginnings. You dream big, infect others with your ideas and find
                committed supporters. In order to get that far, you have already learned a lot and deserve to enjoy this
                exciting phase. However, the magic of new beginnings doesn't last forever, and this is, when beginnings
                start getting difficult.</p>

            <p>Your choice of programming communities (know as discussion boards, forums, bulletin boards, etc.) will
                often determine the pace of your progression in your particular language that you’re learning. I don't
                think there is an answer as to why, but real-time communities provide a one of a kind learning
                experience. Communities like the ones in our chart provide “room” for asking the right questions, and
                more often than not, people will be eager to help you, offer advice and different perspectives on how to
                tackle your bugs. The key element to these communities is to research your questions before you ask
                them!</p>
